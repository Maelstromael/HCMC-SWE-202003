Sample project 
for Patients management

You can clone or download all the file from the repository.
Once you have a version of it, kindly import it to your IDE and import all the Maven dependencies, then run as a Spring Boot Application

I am using a H2 in memory database so, all the data will be saved and accessible during the lifetime of the application. 
Once, you restart it, you will lose all the data except those at the Java class DBInitializer.

The application is working and showing the list of all Patients recorded in the System. 
However, I did not have time to implement UI for saving data or updating.

Enjoy!
